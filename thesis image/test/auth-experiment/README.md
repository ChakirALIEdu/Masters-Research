# Auth Experiment

## Overview
This project is designed to explore user authentication methods, specifically focusing on pattern tracing as a login method. The application allows users to select a login method, enter their credentials, and then engage in a vigilance mode where they must trace a specific pattern to gain access to the main application interface.

## Features
- **Multiple Login Methods**: Users can choose from various authentication methods, including tracing a pattern with the mouse.
- **Vigilance Mode**: After logging in, users must trace a designated pattern to proceed, enhancing security and user engagement.
- **Pattern Validation**: The application validates the traced patterns against predefined templates to ensure accuracy.

## Project Structure
- **src/**: Contains the main application files.
  - **index.html**: Entry point for the application.
  - **css/**: Contains stylesheets for the application.
  - **js/**: Contains JavaScript files for application logic.
  - **components/**: Contains HTML components for different parts of the application.
  - **assets/**: Contains assets such as pattern templates and validation scripts.
- **tests/**: Contains unit tests for the application functionality.
- **config/**: Contains configuration settings for the experiment.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the project.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open `src/index.html` in a web browser to view the application.
4. Ensure that all dependencies are installed if applicable.

## Usage Guidelines
- Select a login method on the main page.
- Enter your login credentials.
- Once logged in, follow the prompts to trace the required pattern in vigilance mode.
- Ensure that the traced pattern matches the predefined templates for successful authentication.

## Experiment Purpose
The goal of this experiment is to assess the effectiveness and user experience of pattern tracing as a login method. By implementing vigilance mode, we aim to enhance security and engage users in a more interactive authentication process.
