# The Login Fortress

A short card game that exemplifies login rituals, their suspicion, and the relations they bring.

Components
> Login Cards with pre-written rituals (blue or magenta backs)
> Blank Cards for creating new rituals
> One envelope containing a “treasure”
> One Game Master who verifies rituals and observes play

Setup
> 3–8 players
> Game Master verifies if login rituals are complete, checks guesses, keeps blank cards lawful, gives final envelope.
> Deal one Login Card face-down to each player
> Each player shows their Login Card only to the Game Master

Gameplay
The game is played in rounds. One round lasts a max of 4 minutes.

A round ends when either:
> One player completes their Login Card ritual, OR
> All but one player are eliminated.

At any moment, a player may attempt to perform the ritual on their Login Card:
> If they claim success, the Game Master checks the card.
> If the ritual was performed correctly:
> The card is revealed and placed in front of the player...
> The player keeps the card as a completed login...
> The player receives a Blank Card, writes a new ritual, and secretly gives it to another player (the recipient now has this hidden login)...
> --- > If incorrect, play continues.

At any time, a player may guess what is written on another player’s Login Card:
> If the guess is correct, the targeted player is eliminated.
> If the guess is incorrect, the guesser receives a strike.
> *Three strikes result in elimination.*

**A player immediately wins if they collect three completed Login Cards**
Alternatively, if all other players are eliminated, the last remaining player wins.
The ultimate winner receives the envelope WITH THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOOLARS.

### Notes:
Completed Login Cards are always public once revealed
Blank Cards are kept secret, except to the writer, recipient and the Game Master
Each round’s winner changes the game by creating and circulating a new login ritual
Blank Cards contents are controlled by the Game Master. If unlawful, must be rewritten.
