## Gameplay
The game is played in rounds. One round lasts a max of 4 minutes.

A round ends when either:
> One player completes their Login Card ritual, OR
> All but one player are eliminated.

At any moment, a player may attempt to perform the ritual on their Login Card:
> If they claim success, the Game Master checks the card.
> If the ritual was performed correctly:
> The card is revealed and placed in front of the player...
> The player keeps the card as a completed login...
> The player receives a Blank Card, writes a new ritual, and secretly gives it to another player (the recipient now has this hidden login)...
> --- > If incorrect, play continues.

At any time, a player may guess what is written on another player’s Login Card:
> If the guess is correct, the targeted player is eliminated.
> If the guess is incorrect, the guesser receives a strike.
> *Three strikes result in elimination.*

**A player immediately wins if they collect three completed Login Cards**
Alternatively, if all other players are eliminated, the last remaining player wins.
The ultimate winner receives the envelope WITH THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOOLARS.
