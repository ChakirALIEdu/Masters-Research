"2025/09/11 5:24:14 AM UTC+3","White & English, (closeted irl) nonbinary, nearly 32. ","I only use a laptop.","YouTube, tumblr (although not as much or as often these days...), Flight Rising (petsim website), Discord. I think... it depends on the day - on a workday I'm on either of these for about 2 or 3 hours before and after work, and on my off days, could be most of the day, or only in the evening depending on if I'm doing anything with my family.","Very rarely; last two times (that I remember) that I had to confirm my identity was using YouTube to view a music video that was apparently blocked for sensitive reasons (Phantogram's ""When I'm Small""), and when I had to confirm that I was an adult on discord so I could actually see images (because of recent UK laws).","Permanently, I think it was a previous email address that I couldn't, for the life of me nor anyone else, remember the password for. So I've lost a lot of stuff with that. Temporarily, it might've been when I locked myself out of my Flight Rising account by forgetting the password again, but at least the time limit was 2 hours and I did have that password written down *somewhere*.","Anything that asks me to confirm who I am - a text to my mobile, a requirement of my face, or something. Any ""extra"" ""safety"" step. I do detest 2-factor authentification - something that was implemented in my workplace not long after I started working there, and it makes it even more impossible to log in to my work email and other services.

Veering off-topic maybe just to complain about my workplace, but I'm also supposed to request holidays through the email system-slash-whatever it is (I don't care enough) so that HR can properly organise hearing tests and the like around them, but since I can't access it without having to call someone else to re-set my password and 2-factor authentification, I don't bother, and instead go straight to the hall manager(s) to ask about it, which they oblige (if there's not too many people asking for the same days off already). Maybe if HR weren't busybodying about 2-factor authentification I might actually use the damn thing... but here we are.","I like logging into Flight Rising, if that counts. My dragons :)

But no, I don't actually recall a logging-in that I *enjoyed*. It all just seems like a hassle, even though it means I log-in to something that is *mine* and therefore a bit more personalised, at the least, like my YouTube account (where I stay logged in anyway) with playlists that I make.","Yes.

I do feel like I have a too-simplistic view of online ownership, but my account is my account, which means it's mine and for me. My things :) and also my responsibility.","I'm honestly not sure. I can understand calling and texting (as from a bank) being important, but I do hate it. Just lemme in. But yeah no I don't know. Echolocation would be bonkers, though.","I am curious as to how people's answers will contribute to your thesis, like how it'll inform the outcome of it (?), and also how conflicting people's answers could be and what that means - more than likely, no singular ""one size fits all"" format of login for everyone. If that makes sense. This is also not an actual question, oh boy. Anyway, looking forward to the follow-up survey :) thank you."

"2025/09/11 5:52:44 AM UTC+3","I am from the USA and I'm 30 years old, which I'd say is young enough to have grown up with computers but old enough to remember a time before they were so ubiquitous. Growing up I was taught to be very wary of the internet, especially people who might try to steal my information. Posting my face or details about myself online still feels very vulnerable for me and I try to avoid doing it. I've also worked as a web developer, so I have a bit of experience on the other side of things as an internet user","I use my phone and my desktop computer the most. Throughout the day I'll use my phone for music and podcasts, to look things up, to get directions on how to get places, and to keep in touch with friends and family. My computer I mainly use for creating art these days! Though I also use it for entertainment.","I've been trying to lower my screen time so I don't use all of these as much as I used to, but I'd say the main ones are tumblr, instagram, pinterest, and youtube. tumblr and instagram I use roughly once a month or so while pinterest and youtube I use just about every day, either for research or for fun. It's tough to say how many times throughout the day I use them though... maybe 5-10 times? How long I use them for can also vary quite a bit depending on what I'm looking for or if I'm just trying to veg out. I also use spotify a lot throughout the day, though I've been trying to get away from this as well to try and have more focused time working in silence. Oh and I use gmail for email, which I probably check 3-5 times a day. That one's one of the few apps I have notifications enabled for, so I see notifications as they come in. Ah also Discord, which I'm more likely to check when I see a notification since it's probably from a friend rather than LinkedIn or something lol.","On an average day it's probably 0. I'm almost always using my own devices that I stay logged in on so I don't have to log in much. The only exceptions i can think of are things related to banking or health insurance or billing-related stuff. Apps that contain more sensitive information usually. Some apps that I'm trying to use less I always log out of when I'm done to try and discourage me from using them too much, so those I do have to log into every time I use them, but I don't use them every day anymore.","Just last week actually! I was trying to log into my banking app and I must have typed my password in wrong so I was rejected, then assumed I had remembered the password wrong and started trying different passwords until I got locked out. It wasn't too bad to get back in, but the whole process did feel a bit clunky at times. I guess I'm glad they're protecting my information though. The worst is when you get locked out of goodreads or something. Like ok. guess i'm not using goodreads anymore, you know?","Lately I've been the most frustrated by log in walls that necessitate you login to use a site. I find it so frustrating for example when a friend sends me a tiktok link that I can't watch because I don't have an account, or I have to edit the query param in the url or inspect the page and delete elements to make whatever I'm looking at visible again. I don't think I would have ever made a tumblr account had I not been able to lurk on a few people's blogs before finally deciding to go ahead and join, but now many people's tumblrs are unscrollable if you're not already logged in. I find it very frustrating that that seems to increasingly be the norm on the internet. 
As for the actual login process itself, I think the most frustrating thing is when I'm told I don't have the right password and I can't figure it out, so I go to reset the password and then it tells me that the new password can't be the same as the old password... like what!! when did I change it! lol","If I'm logging in on my phone and receive a code via text message, my phone automatically suggests it in the two factor authentication field so I don't have to leave that login window to open my messages and get the code. I've heard that 2FA via text message isn't as secure as using the login code apps, so maybe that's a convenience I should try and leave behind though...","Ideally yes my accounts would belong to me. One of the things I was taught growing up was that once something goes on the internet, it is there forever. I'm not sure I totally believe that now, but I do feel that being anonymous and being able to disappear completely are important freedoms that should be protected online. Online ownership to me means getting to control who knows what about me. Why is it so difficult for me to find an old tumblr post or a tweet that I know the exact wording of, but if someone knows my phone number they can find my address and the contact information of everyone I've ever known? Why do so many people (at least where I live) seem so eager to take away our right to privacy online and who stands to benefit from that? If I can't own my online accounts, then so be it. But these people are insane if they think I'm going to upload my drivers license for the chance to look at some posts, you know?","There are probably many ways, but I think a lot of them are deeply flawed at best and actively harmful at worst. I find the recent rise of using A.I. or requiring government id for age verification to be very concerning, for example. As far as securing one's account, I don't really have any ideas outside of the typical username, password, two factor authentication system we have now. Maybe we could do more to protect that information to ensure our login info remains ours, or make it easier to recover accounts when they are compromised, but that just raises more questions about how to handle those things I think.","I'd be curious to know how the process of logging in has changed over the years. There's so much focus on capturing people's time and attention to sell ad space within the modern internet that I wonder if the log in process has fallen by the wayside a bit. We also have a lot of services now that handle things like login so web developers aren't having to create their own log in service every time they build a site. Which seems like a good thing since it provides a secure login experience presumably created/looked over by people who know what they're doing, but maybe opens things up for vulnerability since an opening on one site would mean an opening on every site that uses that service? or something....."

I do understand it’s for heightened security, but sometimes bouncing between my phone to search for a code or an email or opening a separate app becomes clunky and inconvenient.","The iPhone’s face recognition has made so many of my logins on my phone smoother. It’s a double-edged sword. A lot of people don’t trust the facial recognition, out of fear that companies may be collecting and skimming face shapes and data for AI training or even citizen databases, but for me personally, I’ve found it useful. ","Online ownership to me means I am the only person who gets to edit any content or algorithms that may develop around my searching habits. Ads are one thing; I haven’t experienced this personally, but I have heard anecdotes about kids on YouTube being fed right-wing content based on nothing at all. It’s concerning and raises worries for me about how much say we really have in our online experience.","Im genuinely not sure. Facial recognition isn’t always feasible for everything, and some websites like banking managers or government websites (to name a couple) could benefit from added security. At this point, it’s about convenience, which is a constantly moving target and could be hard to pin down.","Not a question, but I feel the need to note my internal struggle between convenience/ease of access and security. I’m a person who typically uses variations of the same password with slight alterations depending on the security level. If I could just use one, I would, but with that would come a level of vulnerability and access to a lot of personal information. It’s tough to find that sweet spot of convenience and safety.

"2025/09/11 4:36:52 PM UTC+3","29 years old, Netherlands, Male. ","My mobile phone: Often throughout the day. 
My personal Desktop computer: Start up in the morning and browse during breakfast, and then browse it after work until the evening. 
My work laptop: During the workday.","Depends on your definition of 'the internet'. Does this only include platforms accessed through a browser, or all platforms that use an internet connection, through a browser or through their own applications?
Browser: Mainly Twitch and Youtube, throughout the day as background noise while I work on other things. Additionally, Wikipedia and a local news website intermittently throughout the day to stay informed or to quince my curiosity.

Application wise: Discord, throughout the entire day to keep in touch with my friends and communities im involved in. Steam, to play games in the afternoon and evenings if nothing else is going on.","Good question. As my job is sensitive in nature, I am required to frequently login into several systems throughout my typical workday. I cannot go into exact details but purely based on individual cases of login attempts, this must be in the order of 10s, tho this does count separate steps in 2 factor authentication procedures individually.

Outside of work there is the login into my Desktop. Most of my frequently used applications are already logged in when I start them up, so I don't often have to login once im in my computer. When I need to make use of services im not automatically logged into, I use a password manager to login, thus requiring me to login to the manager first before login into the service I intend to use. My phone on the other hand requires a login attempt every time I try to use it, which intermittently throughout the day adds up. 

All these things considered I imagine the amount of logins I perform on a typical day to be around 50 to 75 times.","A couple of months ago. ","That I did not yet save the password for the website in my password manager and now have to take the time to set it up properly.","Using my password manager to fill in the login details on a website. It saves time and gives the satisfaction of feeling secure.","Thats feels like a question that would require a very thorough moral evaluation to properly answer. But on a superficial level, I would say yes. Online ownership again is messy to define properly, but in short I personally believe it should entail the rights to the usage, distribution and reproduction of any digital media or data one has produced or had produced for themselves, directly or indirectly, regardless of the platform or technology utilized in the production thereof. ","This question feels vague. ""Other ways"" in regards to what? I assume you mean other then through ""login"", although this itself can be vague is its not clearly established what would be defined as ""loggin in""? Like, does this include entering a user name and password, entering a one-time password, any time you have to perform an additional action to access a service, so also things like biometric scanning? The use of a keypass?? Maybe im overthinking things but since its stated this is just an early draft I figured it might be constructive of me to be clear I don't fully understand what is being asked of me here. 

In that regards there is the usage of cookies or similar data, provided by a platform to us that can be used to identify us after we have logged in once. 
Similarly technologies like public-private key signatures combined with a trusted repository of these public keys could serve as a means of verifying once identity, although this relies on the existence and integrity of this trusted repository.","Considering this interest in login attempts, it is definitely worth to consider how once personal background can impact once relation to the act of loggin in. As your first question already asks us to relate any background information that could impact our usage of online technology, I do think it is especially interesting to consider how our socioeconomic backgrounds can impact this. From having access to lots of high-end defices and services, requireing a multitude of loggin attempts, jobs in fields related to secure and trusted access to vital systems, to personal preference shaped by ones own experiences on the internet. In such a way, the act of loggin in itself isnt to proof of our identity, but the context of where we are loggin in becomes itself a part of our identity. As Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein put it in his theories on language games, the meaning we ascribe is derived from the context of our personal lives. So inversely our personal lives could be defined in the meaning we derive from the words spoken to us, and the places we log into. While such 'meta data' is undoubtetly already being used to sculpt the online persona of ours auctioned off by data brokers and used by advertisement agencies among others, I believe the more philosophical nature of this truth is not yet fully understood, nor discussed. This too, may very well be one of the many unanswered questions we may yet tackle, in this thesis or in another, along the likes of ""What does it mean to be human"", ""Can we create digital life"", or ""What is the air-speed velocity of an unladden swallow?"". All questions worthy of consideration, the answer to which we may never fully know..."

Similar for my computer, but less frequently - I tend to sit and use it for longer periods, rather than jumping on and off.  
The main platform I have to log into a lot is canvas for school.  Other than that, pretty much everything I frequent keeps me logged in by default, so I don't have to put in my information again and again ","A couple weeks ago, when trying to log into a scholarship website from my previous college ","Definitely two factor authorization, ESPECIALLY when it's not optional.  It also really annoys me when I try to log in with just my email or username and it tries to force me into logging in via google or another platform","The most positive login experiences for me are the ones where I can just get in, and there's no extra gizmos and whistles, or extra hoops I have to jump through","To me, online ownership means that I have control over my things (files, things I write/create, my experience, tools, etc) and I get to keep those things permanently.  I have /ownership/ over the files on my computer.  I do not have /ownership/ over the media I can access through streaming services.  
I do strongly believe in online ownership.  Especially in cases where we pay for a service, I strongly believe that we should have ownership over our accounts and the things on them.  If I pay for a video game, I should be able to retain access to it indefinitely","There are definitely other ways they could identify me but I don't want them to identify me beyond the bare minimum.  Email, password, possibly a username if they require it, and I do understand that some websites need my birthday to adhere to laws.  Beyond that I don't want to give them anything",""
"2025/09/11 7:22:35 PM UTC+3","21, USA, male, been using the internet since I was 11 :(","PC (Windows) and phone (android), multiple times a day if not most of the day","Tumblr, Discord, YouTube, Instagram. Discord takes up a lot of my hours, I am actively on it and like most other people its usually on in the background too. I've had to put on an app time limit on Instagram because if I don't watch myself I'll just spend hours on reels.","3-6 give or take, depends on what I'm doing. Since the android software is connected to your google account, trying to log in or change settings on some applications may use your phone's passcode/PIN to 'make sure it's you'.","Genuinely a few days ago. My phone broke, until it's fixed I am locked out of any website that wants to send a verification code to my phone number or wants to contact my phone to allow me to login.","This is an abnormal one but the most frustrating experience I've had was this. The website didn't allow you to sign in with your username and a password, but instead gave you a personalized 36-digit password when you made the account (no username! you only log in with the password!) and the login page had all 36 digits in separate boxes so you couldn't copy and paste your password to log in. They claimed it's for security but I seriously don't know how, sure it'll be hard to guess someone else's password but if you get someone else's password then its easier than needing to take a username AND a password. The only extremely annoying part is logging in... which should not be an extremely annoying experience.

A more normal experience is a few years ago I was trying to get back into a gmail account I made when I was younger. I knew the password, but it wouldn't let me sign in without a verification code from a phone number that belongs to an old phone that doesn't exist anymore. So I can't recover my account. Some accounts attached to that gmail address are also gone because those accounts won't allow me to login without email verification.

So my most frustrating experience (especially recently) has been phone verification.","Anything that doesn't need you to connect to google or other platforms/websites to login.","Yes and no? I think you should have the right to keep everything on an account you make, but if this is an account on the internet that means somewhere there has to be a server holding that data. Ultimately if a website or server goes down, that data is lost. If something on an account is really really important to you, you should keep it somewhere that isn't maintained by someone else.
But 'online ownership' doesn't really mean anything to me as the kind of person who tries to find CDs and DVDs of music and movies I like because I don't trust streaming platforms to always be reliable and there. The same goes for an account, I think it's right for it to be in your ownership, but the thing is, you're not the person who has your data. Someone else has that data, so you don't have control over it. ","I don't really want online platforms identifying me. I understand the importance of more security and that I can't just have my cake and eat it too, that things like phone verification are an attempt to have security, but that makes it difficult. What about people without phones or just don't want one? 

I guess personalized security questions could be helpful, like the ""whats the name of your first pet"" thing but I feel like there should be better security questions and an option for you to ask your own questions. Of course there's always the chance that you'll get yourself locked out of an account of 10 years and you go back and don't know how to answer questions you set up for yourself 10 years ago, but at least that feels like it's more of your fault. There could be a system to remind you if those security questions need changing every couple of years though.

That brings social engineering into question because anyone trying to steal your password can try to message you (ask about your first pet etc) but social engineering is how a lot people get scammed anyways nowadays so it's not like it's anything new.","Sorry if this wasn't any help or I went on some ramble that isn't helpful for this. I just thought it was funny to come across this after my phone broke and I've been annoyed about all the shit I've been locked out of since."
