## ACT 3 ACT 1 - Topic and research question(s)

No earlier than last night, I received a flag warning on Instagram, telling me my account may have been suspected of being a bot, a non-human content creator, whose access to the website could be revoked in a flash. That's without mentioning the countless fights to login, to logout, to talk with IT, to accept dubious TOS at our expenses... The login experience, in recent years, has turned into a horrible experience that we aim to tame.

There is a power asymmetry at play here. At the very moment we access an online platform, our accounts do not belong to us. (Some may say this is obvious;  we only ring the doorbell to the fortress, and we own no keys, no room, nothing.)

We're only allowed access, at any given time. But the user experience is designed in such a way to make you believe that accounts online belong to you, and so does your data. How much of that is true? (Lately, I have personally been feeling like I do not control what part of myself gets online or not.)

Why do platforms treat my identity, data, and memories as assets I lease rather than own? Why am I no longer trusted with my own data and its access?
Where is the login experience headed?
What would onboarding look like if, if we could design the login experience give people more agency? or affordance?

### ACT 3 INTERMISSION 1

Politics notwithstanding, I do experience a great deal of issues regarding trust, due to my lived racialised experience. And even aside from that, user experiences regarding anything with my data always involves a fair share of distrust, as if I wasn't welcomed to deal with my data. 
Microsoft Outlook logs users out all the time, 2FA makes account sharing impossible, TOS are designed to look more like a texture than a text worth reading... Just how much of the onboarding experience is unpleasant, really?
“Why am I no longer trusted with my own data and its access?”
“Is trust even possible at scale, without coercion?”
So maybe I’m not just researching login rituals...

## ACT 3 ACT 2 - References / Methodology
Key References:

    Les Tyrannies de l’intimité – Richard Sennett
Sennett critiquzes the breakdown of public/private boundaries. The demand for transparency and intimacy erode privacy and leave individuals vulnerable in the name of “authentic” relationship. 

    Programmed Visions – Wendy Hui Kyong Chun

"Code as logos not only
extends the power of individual programmers, it also makes code itself both legisla-
tion and execution: it spreads a neoliberal empowerment through the embedding of
governmental enforcement into everyday situations, making us “ subjects ” of code."

I want to adopt an auto-ethnographic method, like I have done in my notes: Documented experiences with frustrating access login experiences (Outlook, Pokémon TCG, etc.). a lens that privileges lived experience as a source of design insight. It is a lens that privileges lived experience as a source of design insight.

Quantitative interviews with users who’ve experienced friction with logins, account recovery, platform lockouts... The goal would be to amass multiple users per platform and ask about their experiences and see what I can gather from there.



### ACT 3 INTERMISSION 2


I need to read a lot of those resources actually. I need to ahdere to a philosophy and express it within my research. Senett's philosophy so far speaks to me most.
