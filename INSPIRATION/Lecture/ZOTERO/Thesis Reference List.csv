Users complain of their content being unfairly suppressed by ''the algorithm'', particularly users with marginalised identities such as LGBTQ+ users. Together with content removal, this suppression acts to censor what is shared on the platform. Journalists have revealed biases in automatic censorship, as well as human moderation. We investigate experiences of censorship on TikTok, across users marginalised by their gender, LGBTQ+ identity, disability or ethnicity. We survey 627 UK-based TikTok users and find that marginalised users often feel they are subject to censorship for content that does not violate community guidelines. We highlight many avenues for future research into censorship on TikTok, with a focus on users' folk theories, which greatly shape their experiences of the platform.","2024-07-19","2024-11-04 13:10:35","2024-11-04 13:10:35","2024-11-04 13:10:35","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2407.14164","","C:\Users\Chakir\Zotero\storage\6Q8JRLEW\Ungless et al. - 2024 - Experiences of Censorship on TikTok Across Marginalised Identities.pdf; C:\Users\Chakir\Zotero\storage\RAC86K3W\2407.html","","","Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2407.14164","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The influx of social media digital spaces, like TikTok, has also shifted the ways multimodal composition takes place alongside AI. This study aims to argue that within spaces like TikTok, human composers must attend to the ways they write for, with and against the AI-powered algorithm. Design/methodology/approach Data collection was drawn from a larger study on #BookTok (the TikTok subcommunity for readers) that included semi-structured interviews including watching and reflecting on a TikTok they created. The authors grounded this study in critical posthumanist literacies to analyze and open code five #BookTok content creators’ interview transcripts. Using axial coding, authors collaboratively determined three overarching and entangled themes: writing for, with and against. Findings Findings highlight the nuanced ways #BookTokers consider the AI algorithm in their compositional choices, namely, in the ways how they want to disseminate their videos to a larger audience or more niche-focused community. Throughout the interviews, participants revealed how the AI algorithm was situated differently as both audience member, co-author and censor. Originality/value This study is grounded in critical posthumanist literacies and explores composition as a joint accomplishment between humans and machines. The authors argued that it is necessary to expand our human-centered notions of what it means to write for an audience, to co-author and to resist censorship or gatekeeping.","2024-01-01","2024-11-04 13:11:14","2024-11-04 13:11:14","2024-11-04 13:11:14","118-134","","1","23","","","Writing with, for, and against the algorithm","","","","","","","","","","","","Emerald Insight","","Publisher: Emerald Publishing Limited","","C:\Users\Chakir\Zotero\storage\QN2HXU9F\html.html","","","Artificial intelligence; BookTok; Critical posthumanist literacy; Multimodal composition; TikTok","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The decision to opt for strict terms of use governing nudity and sexual depiction was as fast as it was drastic, leading to the quick erasure of subcultural networks developed over a decade. This article maps out platform critiques of and on Tumblr through a combination of visual and digital methods. By analyzing 7306 posts made between November 2018 (when Tumblr announced its new content policy) and August 2019 (when Verizon sold Tumblr to Automattic), we explore the key stakes and forms of user resistance to Tumblr “porn ban” and the affective capacities of user-generated content to mobilize engagement.","2022-06-01","2024-11-04 13:11:47","2024-11-04 13:11:47","2024-11-04 13:11:47","1459-1480","","6","24","","","Nipples, memes, and algorithmic failure","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications","","C:\Users\Chakir\Zotero\storage\37AY52LM\Pilipets et Paasonen - 2022 - Nipples, memes, and algorithmic failure NSFW critique of Tumblr censorship.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, operating these techniques continuously is labor-intensive and requires specialized knowledge and synchronization, leading to limited adoption. In this paper, we introduce Censored Planet, an online censorship measurement platform that collects and analyzes measurements from ongoing deployments of four remote measurement techniques (Augur, Satellite/Iris, Quack, and Hyperquack). Censored Planet adopts a modular design that supports synchronized baseline measurements on six Internet protocols as well as customized measurements that target specific countries and websites. Censored Planet has already collected and published more than 21.8 billion data points of longitudinal network observations over 20 months of operation. Censored Planet complements existing censorship measurement platforms such as OONI and ICLab by offering increased scale, coverage, and continuity. We introduce a new representative censorship metric and show how time series analysis can be applied to Censored Planet's longitudinal measurements to detect 15 prominent censorship events, two-thirds of which have not been reported previously. Using trend analysis, we find increasing censorship activity in more than 100 countries, and we identify 11 categories of websites facing increasing censorship, including provocative attire, human rights issues, and news media. We hope that the continued publication of Censored Planet data helps counter the proliferation of growing restrictions to online freedom.","2020-11-02","2024-11-04 13:11:53","2024-11-04 13:11:53","2024-11-04","49–66","","","","","","Censored Planet","CCS '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","C:\Users\Chakir\Zotero\storage\7Q9MWE2Y\Sundara Raman et al. - 2020 - Censored Planet An Internet-wide, Longitudinal Censorship Observatory.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A qualitative survey analysis was conducted ( N = 513), assessing user interactions with the consent materials of a fictitious social media service, NameDrop. Findings suggest that clickwraps serve a political economic function by facilitating the circumvention of consent materials. Herman and Chomsky’s notion of the “buying mood” guides the analysis to analogize how social media maintain flow to monetized sections of services while diverting attention from policies that might encourage dissent. Clickwraps accomplish this through an agenda-setting function whereby prompts encouraging circumvention are made more prominent than policy links. Results emphasize that clickwraps discourage engagement with privacy and reputation protections by suggesting that consent materials are unimportant, contributing to the normalization of this circumvention. The assertion that clickwraps serve a political economic function suggests that capitalist methods of production are successfully being integrated into social media services and have the ability to manufacture consent.","2018-07","2025-04-10 14:56:49","2025-04-10 14:56:49","2025-04-10 14:56:49","2056305118784770","","3","4","","Social Media + Society","The Clickwrap","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Chakir\Zotero\storage\7K6AUBXI\Obar et Oeldorf-Hirsch - 2018 - The Clickwrap A Political Economic Mechanism for Manufacturing Consent on Social Media.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Her seminal book In the Age of the Smart Machine foresaw the consequences of a then-unfolding era of computer technology. Now, three decades later she asks why the once-celebrated miracle of digital is turning into a nightmare. Zuboff tackles the social, political, business, personal, and technological meaning of ""surveillance capitalism"" as an unprecedented new market form. It is not simply about tracking us and selling ads, it is the business model for an ominous new marketplace that aims at nothing less than predicting and modifying our everyday behavior--where we go, what we do, what we say, how we feel, who we're with. The consequences of surveillance capitalism for us as individuals and as a society vividly come to life in The Age of Surveillance Capitalism's pathbreaking analysis of power. The threat has shifted from a totalitarian ""big brother"" state to a universal global architecture of automatic sensors and smart capabilities: A ""big other"" that imposes a fundamentally new form of power and unprecedented concentrations of knowledge in private companies--free from democratic oversight and control""--","2019","2025-04-10 14:57:08","2025-04-10 14:57:08","","","691","","","","","The age of surveillance capitalism","","","","","PublicAffairs","New York","","","","","","Library of Congress ISBN","HF5415.32 .Z83 2019","","","","","","Consumer behavior; Consumer profiling; Data processing; Information technology; Social aspects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","First edition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
