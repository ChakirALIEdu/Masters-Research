# List of Terms/Topics 

### Idiosyncracies
"a peculiarity of constitution or temperament : an individualizing characteristic or quality" [Source from Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/idiosyncrasy)

Joël Vacheron says: 
> "Idiosyncracies [...] We talk about the first programs. They were always marked by the singularity or the identity of programmers. Something always linked of the identity of those that produce it- Idiosyncracies."

### Design and choice...?
What IS Design? What IS choice, to begin with? Choice is the act of choosing between two or more possibilities. Design is a practice or artistic vocation, mostly industrial or commercial. (I think.)

### End-to-End Encryption
"End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a secure communication process that encrypts data before transferring it to another endpoint. Data stays encrypted in transit and is decrypted on the recipient’s device. Messaging apps, SMS and other communications services rely on E2EE to protect messages from unauthorized access." [Source from IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/end-to-end-encryption)

### Soft Coercion
A form of control, which subtly influences people's behavior through convenience. (or social norms, or interface design, anything without overt force really..) In UX, it often appears as “defaults,” hidden options, opt-in opt-outc or nudges disguised as helpful features. (Turn on your location or smth)

### User Interface
UI, UX...What are those?

### Dead internet
Not to be confused with the quirky internet conspiracy theory. When people I quote say "the internet is dead", they mean that they have no control like they did in the past. The joy, freedom, interesting design and openness seems to have disappeared in the eyes of internauts.


### Net Neutrality
"Net neutrality is the principle that internet service providers (ISPs) treat all online traffic equally and openly, without discrimination, blocking, throttling or prioritisation." [Source from Eur-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/EN/legal-content/glossary/open-internet-and-net-neutrality.html#:~:text=Net%20neutrality%20is%20the%20principle,compliance%20with%20legal%20obligations;)

### Invisible visible, visible invisible
Wendy Chun mentions this in her book "Programmed Visions."

> "When enough seemingly insignificant data is analyzed against billions of data elements, the
invisible becomes visible." — Seisint (Quote from a quote from Programmed Visions by Wend Chun)

> "Software, through programming languages that stem from a gendered system of command and control, creates an invisible system of visibility, a system of causal pleasure. This system renders our machine's normal processes demonic and makes our computer truly a medium: some-thing in between, mystical, channeling, and not entirely trustworthy. It becomes a conduit that also amplifies and selects what is at once real and unreal, true and untrue, visible and invisible."

In the context of software, it's data or language normally intelligible or unknowable rendered visible through software, machines. CODE is an invisible visible, because it is intelligible words that in turn, through a process, generatea the visualisation of data, "mystically." (or the opposite? a visible invisible? idk, I really lost the plot there)


### Autonomous zones
Zones in which people have full autonomy (either physically, digitally, momentarily... Place people have sovereignty over their own actions and properties)
Hakim Bey talks about this... Though, I haven't really looked into it deep enough. 

### Comfort = coercion
My original phrase! :o) Describes how systems that prioritize “comfort” can reduce resistance, friction. Not for ease, but for compliance!  Surveillance and exploitation feel normal, even desirable.

### Manufactured consent (through UX)
Originally coined by Noam Chomsky. In my context: when design and UI/UX structures shape people's behavior in such a way that consent is implied or assumed, not genuinely given (especially in ToS agreements and default settings.)

### Dark Patterns
Deceptive UX practices that trick users into doing things they didn’t intend (e.g., subscribing, consenting to tracking, sharing data). Often involved in soft coercion and obfuscation of info...
