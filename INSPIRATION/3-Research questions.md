# Potential Research questions


### "Your favourite designers design discomfort"

> What are the methods used to engineer comfort and discomfort in users in order to control their choices? What is the future of privacy?

*"Convenience in the face of discomfort is a trap; someone designed it that way."*

### "Convenient" Updates = Control?

> When and why did “quality of life” become a euphemism for control? Is it always the case? Is it true?

Look into it through game design, user interfaces...? I feel like that statement isn't inherently true. Some updates aim to facilitate usage like organising items in an inventory, or keeping things neat and tidy. I'm not really talking about "Quality of Life" or Conveniency moreso than I'm talking about privacy-erosion under the guise of comfort or accessibility. Need to reframe it.

### Design becomes a coercion tactic. Design reforms consent.

> What happens to agency when privacy (or lack thereof) is not a choice, but a precondition of access?

"Exposure and visibility thus become **consent** in the eyes of others." You are seen, therefore you are accessible, therefore you are my possession if I so choose.
