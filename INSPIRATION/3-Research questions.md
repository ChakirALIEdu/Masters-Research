# Potential Research questions

    (・・?)


## "Your favourite designers design discomfort"

> What are the methods used to engineer comfort and discomfort in users in order to control their choices? What is the future of privacy?

*"Convenience in the face of discomfort is a trap; someone designed it that way."*

Peter talked anout anti homeless architecture. Benched, urban planning. Parking garages, windows, gaps, deters against committing crimes— as criminals can be "watched".

## "Convenient" Updates = Control?
>
> When and why did “quality of life” become a euphemism for control? Is it always the case? Is it true?

Look into it through game design, user interfaces...? I feel like that statement isn't inherently true. Some updates aim to facilitate usage like organising items in an inventory, or keeping things neat and tidy. I'm not really talking about "Quality of Life" or Convenience... moreso than I'm talking about privacy-erosion under the guise of comfort or accessibility. Need to reframe it.

## Design is coercion. 

> What happens to people's agency when the loss of privacy is not a choice, but a precondition of access?

*"Exposure and visibility thus become **consent** in the eyes of others."*


Like in regards to Google Maps for example, how many things ahev we accepted that encroach in our privacy? Decurity cameras, maps, things we take for face value that do a bunch of things.


Tech literacy, young people, "file path structure", how much stuff we take for granted
You are seen, therefore you are accessible, therefore you are my possession if I so choose.


#  FRICTIONLESS DESIGN IS COERCION AND CONTROL. FRICTION IS THE ALTERNATIVE, AND THE SOLUTION.

> The goal would be to prove the following:
- What is frictionless design and why is it bad?
- Why do I say "Design is coercion"? Origin of those philosophies, methods used, applications daily...
- What will happen in the future?
- What are the alternatives? 
- What is the solution?

My actual goal would be to prove an alternative can work. 
I want to write about an alternative in which softwares can gain success by allowing more control to users, or at the very least stepping back from this control (which also inadvertently creates computer illiteracy...)

I want to prove that NOT using design to coerce users is better, if possible. I think that's the goal of my master's thesis. Prove that an alternative is so good, so truthful, so inevitable, that the method we're using now is obsolete and outrageous in comparison.
