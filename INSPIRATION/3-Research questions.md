# Potential Research questions

### "Your favourite designers design discomfort"

*Convenience in the face of discomfort is a trap; someone designed it that way."*

### Quality of Life Updates = Control?

Look into it through game design, user interfaces...? I feel like that statement isn't inherently true. Some updates aim to facilitate usage like organising items in an inventory, or keeping things neat and tidy. I'm not really talking about "Quality of Life" moreso than I'm talking about privacy-erosion under the guise of comfort or accessibility. Need to reframe it.
