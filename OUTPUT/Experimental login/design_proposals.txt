Design proposals (summary)

This document summarizes three design proposals developed as interactive prototypes: (1) Presence-confirmation login, (2) Password Quests (micro-task triage), and (3) Authenticator improvements (color-by-position + rotor input). Each proposal emphasizes usability, accessibility, and empirical evaluation.

1. Presence-confirmation login
A short, time-limited interaction (e.g. perform a simple action within 30 s) confirms user presence before granting access. Goal: increase user awareness and reduce accidental or automated logins while keeping friction low. Key considerations: provide clear instructions, optional extension or alternative methods for users requiring more time, and full ARIA/voice support. Evaluate via success rate, completion time, abandonment and perceived clarity.

2. Password Quests
Break down remediation of compromised credentials into daily micro‑tasks (e.g. 2–3 small tasks/day). The manager proposes an ordered plan, guides the user to change a password manually, and records the new credential only when supplied. Goal: reduce cognitive load and procrastination. Privacy note: local encrypted storage or secure manager APIs should be used; prototype confirms no outbound transmission.

3. Authenticator: color-by-position + rotor input
Display 6-digit OTPs with a stable color/shape per position and a legend; offer alternate entry via a circular rotary dial or per-position rotors. Goal: improve short-term visual retention and provide a tactile/sequential entry that may reduce input errors on small devices. Accessibility: include non‑color cues (shapes, labels), keyboard and screen-reader support, and user toggles for color, contrast and motion.

Evaluation and integration
Treat these features as configurable options with fallbacks to standard flows. Recommended evaluation mixes lab and short longitudinal studies: task success, time-on-task, error rates, and user preference collected across diverse participants. Prioritize accessibility testing with assistive technologies.
