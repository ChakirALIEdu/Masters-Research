#  Book design

In terms of book I want to make, I'm mostly interested in a smaller format than A4, way smaller. A5 or A6, in those waters.

The books I was into were 10x18 cm and 14x20cm. Another was at 10x15. How do they invite lecture with their dimensions? 
Frankly, I don't think I know yet. I have an idea, but it's too blurry.

The link between form and content is notable in one book, Margot Herbelin's on flora in video game. She had an eco-sensitive approach to printing, using reusable papers and being relatively simple and rustic in its design. Though, is it eco-sensitive to take this approach?
A lot of those books are a dos-carré collé, for the most part. Glued backs, etc... Pages are then turned pretty easily. 

What I like about those small formats is the intimate aspect of it. There's something perrsonal and close to the body that comes with a pocket book, which I think inscribes itself in the content of my thesis as well, what with how personnal the login experience can be. It's hard to share a pocket book or look through it with another person - so it's a designed personnal experience. That's probably my intent, if I were to make my own book. I mean, I AM going to make my own book anyways but I digress. You get me.

The amount of pages go from 70 to 144, quite the content indeed!

But the edition inside in some of these books is what really attracts me. We've got plenty of booknotes/notabene on the sides, images are front and center, or in the columns. I do also like a book that lets a page breathe, that lets an image breathe. but too much and the content might seem empty. There should be a form of rythmicality to the contents of a book - swatches of pages filled to the brim with content, with breaks with images and graphics.

I do think it would be great to have laser cut cover. Ooooh how neat it would be if like, you could slide your "username" into the cover of the book, with like une languette that you slide inside. something like "The current owner of this book is (username)" you know?

Double layers to it. I like books that have a simple colour theme as well. And as I am writing this, I am also faced with an immense amount of sadness and fear and disappointment with myself. I fear I may suck horribly.

The papers used in some books are Lessebo Smooth Natural 150gr, Recystar Natural 70g, and some just say recycled paper.

Fonts used were "Anthony Sun Young Oh, Velvetyne.fr", "Satoshi, Deni Anggara, Indian Type Foundry", DIN, and ITC Garamond.

The books I think are great examples are titled like this:

"Le rôle de la flore dans le jeu vidéo et son appropriation par la communauté" de Margot Herbelin
"Hacking Degrowth" de Jonas Wolter
"Arabic Letter-forms in motion" by Francois Harik
and "Prosthetic Memory" by Praiya Chinagarn...

In that respect, pray tell, what would my printed book look like...

I think something with a pocket format is nice. 

What are the ratios of the books I found...

i like a 5:9
7:10
2:3
...

I guess I'll go with the one closest to the golden ration, which is the 2:3 one, But I would probably upscale it by a few centimeters. 12x18cm? That sounds nice. About 100 pages, dos-carré collé. Paper grammage would probably be around 120gr...
Rhythm of dense text clusters + breathing spaces.
Marginalia / notes to mimic interface sidebars.
Minimal, intimate colour palette...
Cover with slot for a username card...

Colors vert riso, orange riso, something

Peter talked to me about moirés. That would be so cool

I would love to have this book be locked, and a moira key would be used to open it. Does that make sense? In my mind it does make sense.
