# Thoughts

Observing the references I found. 

Reflections on terms and services for example. Not exactly sure this would actually yield any insight, actually.

Here are the terms and services from Linkedin.

> 3. Intellectual Property

> 3.1    License. You grant to LinkedIn (and its affiliates) a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license to use, copy, modify, distribute and publish any content You provide to LinkedIn. The foregoing license survives termination of this Contract with regard to content provided prior to termination. 

I find that impressive, and linked to my point in previous documents.
"If it's on the web, it's accessible." Proprietary rights blur and disappear as users participate in platforms meant to aid in their careers or social interactions. 
But that's not design. That's terms and services. What's really compelling is how people agree to those things.

The services of Linkedin becomes indispensable by design due to how its community and the usage of this platforms aids in people's careers. It becomes an indispensable piece of social media. Too many times, people tell me I need to jeep my Linkedin up to date. How many of those users read those terms and services? About none of them, I'd almost wager.

Incidentally, the way terms and conditins are designed is also deliberate. Thin font, capital letters, with the drapeau being too squared; type like this becomes more like a texture than a text worth reading. 
The readability of it all is no different than ready a block of Lorem Ipsum. 

Actually, this makes me think about how deliberate it is.
Terms and Services pages are always designed in such a way that makes the page look "legally official". Getting on Nintendo and looking at their terms and services page â€” you'd immediately notice their pages is distinctly different design-wise, from all their other User Interfaces. Do they do this for readability? I certainly believe that is the case. The text-formatting is dull and simple, hard to read as well. That is a deliverate design choice. They don't want users to enjoy reading this. The text has long-winded sentences, with jargon that is hard to understand for clients. 

Your favourite designers design discomfort. 
Your favourite designers designed your terms and conditions page to be illegible.
