# Notable Quotes Insights


Just compiling quotes and sentences from my research to help understand points, arguments, and other ideas I came across. 
In order to reach a coherent research, I need to go back to what my points were.

#  FRICTIONLESS DESIGN IS COERCION AND CONTROL. FRICTION IS THE ALTERNATIVE, AND THE SOLUTION.

> The goal would be to prove the following:
- What is frictionless design and why is it bad?
- Why do I say "Design is coercion"? Origin of those philosophies, methods used, applications daily...
- What will happen in the future?
- What are the alternatives? 
- What is the solution?

> My actual goal would be to prove an alternative can work. 
I want to write about an alternative in which softwares can gain success by allowing more control to users, or at the very least stepping back from this control (which also inadvertently creates computer illiteracy...)

> I want to prove that NOT using design to coerce users is better, if possible. I think that's the goal of my master's thesis. Prove that an alternative is so good, so truthful, so inevitable, that the method we're using now is obsolete and outrageous in comparison.

## Yesterday's insights

I'll write down notes from Joël Vacheron.

> NOTES: Definition de la friction a me réapproprier. (une dimension éthnographique dans mon travail qui doit rester...)

> NOTES: (l'homme public, perdre de vu l'homme public, perdu l'épaisseur du tissu social...)
> NOTES: (Privacy, why do I use that word... DEFINE IT) (Digital Neocolonialism, compare TOS to treaties that colonizers forced on indigenous people.)

There is an ethnographic aspect to my research and studies that are interesting to look further into. Branching out to broaden my knowledge and angles of attack would only benefit the point of my research, my argumentation and the way I express myself. 

Ethnography - Definition: 
> "descriptive study of a particular human society or the process of making such a study. Contemporary ethnography is based almost entirely on fieldwork and requires the complete immersion of the anthropologist in the culture and everyday life of the people who are the subject of his study." quote from [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/ethnography), accessed on 2024-05-29 at 09:23am. 

## The Inverse Relationship Between Comfort and Privacy

> "To design is to control choices. But how much control is too much?" - 2025-04-02

> "The design of coercion. Design IS coercion." - 2025-04-10

The prerequisites for connecting are no longer: create an account, have a password, you get to enter. You no longer control this. They grant you access, and they will take advantage of that. An ongoing performance of trust." - 2025-04-09
