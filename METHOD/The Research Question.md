# Assignment 2 – Research Question, Motivation, and Methodology

## Research Question
How does frictionless design—especially through access rituals like logins, app onboarding, and TOS erode user agency? What relationships do we develop with logins?

## Motivation
This research emerges m discomfort with how “ease” and “accessibility” have been misconstrued in recent years to allow for less and less user agency. Design often leads to the removal of a user's ability to think, intervene, or act. My aim is to critically question the ethics of such design, and propose friction not as failure, but as a meaningful choice that yields better results.

## Literature and Related Projects
- Chun, Wendy – *Programmed Visions*
- Tsing, Anna – *Friction*
- Galloway, Alexander – *The Interface Effect*
- Olia Lialina – *Rich UX and the Desktopization of War*
- The Clickwrap study by Obar & Oeldorf-Hirsch
- Terms of Service design comparisons (e.g. Baldur’s Gate vs Nintendo)

## Methodology
I will use a mixed-method, such as the following:
- Auto-ethnographic fieldwork (documenting personal interactions with platforms)
- Interface criticism (analyzing visual/UX patterns across platforms)
- Light comparative studies (Google Maps, Apple, SwissTransfer)
- 3–5 informal interviews with digital users (especially those less technically literate)

## Tools and Materials
- Markdown documentation on GitHub
- Annotated screenshots and visual artifacts
- Short survey??? or open interviews?? idk (to be scheduled)

## Clarifications
- Interviews: 3–5? uncertain, not too official, focused on discomfort and access friction
- Places: Online environments (account login pages, file sharing, GPS apps)
- Data: Written logs, interface screenshots, user responses
