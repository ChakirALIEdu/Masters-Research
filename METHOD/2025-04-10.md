Erosion, in all corners of life, slowly rolled out. Bit by bit, update by update.

Users are too "stupid" to figure out passwords and protect themselves, so we'll protect them.
Users are too stupid to make the right choices when it comes to this object I designed. We need to dumb it down.
We need to hold the hands of users.

The design of coercion.

Design IS coercion. 

How far are we willing to go? 

Just like doctors make an oath, we need ethics. We need an ethics to design, rules that will keep us from destroying all joys of life through coercion and manipulation tactics.
