A  supposedly neutral service (Google Maps) leads people into trespassing, because it ignores the nuances of private vs public space. The map doesn’t ask permission. 

## The world is Google's oyster. We're living in it.


In that sense, technology destroys spatial ethics; if it’s on the map, it’s accessible.


Similarly, even when people have access to their own online free real estates (NeoCities... a form of digital counterculture), one can still trespass, steal html code, encroach in their spaces... If it's on the web, it's accessible.
