# Synapses (2025-04-11)

I keep saying it, but it would be nice to review all my notes and compile a list of all of my insights and discoveries. 

Ultimately, I think it would be really cool to write an essay, a short one. I think I can write a quick and dirty one in 45 minutes.

The topic of this essay: has design ever aided in removing user agency? if so, how and why?
Or maybe another question... I'll find my problematic. 

Expect a long essay below or in tomorrow's entry.
