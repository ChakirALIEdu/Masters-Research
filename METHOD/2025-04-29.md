# Writing tips and notes

        ദ്ദി •⩊• )

## Yesterday's insights

I'll write down notes from Joël Vacheron.

> NOTES: Definition de la friction a me réapproprier. (une dimension éthnographique dans mon travail qui doit rester...)

> NOTES: (l'homme public, perdre de vu l'homme public, perdu l'épaisseur du tissu social...)
> NOTES: (Privacy, why do I use that word... DEFINE IT) (Digital Neocolonialism, compare TOS to treaties that colonizers forced on indigenous people.)

> There is an ethnographic aspect to my research and studies that are interesting to look further into. Branching out to broaden my knowledge and angles of attack would only benefit the point of my research, my argumentation and the way I express myself. 

Ethnography - Definition: 
> "descriptive study of a particular human society or the process of making such a study. Contemporary ethnography is based almost entirely on fieldwork and requires the complete immersion of the anthropologist in the culture and everyday life of the people who are the subject of his study." quote from [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/ethnography), accessed today (title of md file) at 09:23am. 

## Thoughts and interactions

I think I really like this aspect of study, in which I observe people, gather data from their experiences and thoughts. 
Speaking of... This reminds me of streamers I saw last weekend that talked about something similar to my topic. Due to how rowdy and crass they were being, I'm afraid of quoting them in full here. 

"A good product is a tolerable product [in the minds of shareholders]" is something Jared Slawski said on a stream. This was about Discord going from private to public, and the new CEO of the company being Activision  Blizzard's previous CEO - spelling disaster for the future of Discord. People fear that with him in that role, Discord would be monetized even more, covered in advertisement, or worse... (Reminds me of my mom's experience with Visilab from 2025-04-12)...

But that's in the future.  My main observation is less about the content of his sentence and moreso the overall sentiment of people regarding those changes. It seems like this is the popular thought in most circles I hang around in. But is it actually? Are people *feeling* this erosion of intimacy/privacy which I am talking about? I would need to ask around in interviews, without leading them on...


Also, Félicien is here to give us pro tips.

He talks about IMSI catches which are "fake cellphone towers" that are deployed during protests. Phones connect to those towers and law enforcement as a result gets access to IMSI data which is specific to every SIM card, and then they can ask callphone providers which code belongs to whom, thus identifying the people at the protest.

State of the art - depicts the actual developments around your research question into  the academic field, but also in design practices + 
helps you contextualise your theoretical framework.

Identify what's been done so far and propose something that can help the research go further.

My research shouldn't lack epistemological rigour - maybe the research can seem goofy but it needs to remain serious.

Research into design include:
historical research, aesthetic or perceptual research, reserach into a variety of theoretical perspectives on art and design - social, economic, political, ethical, cultural, iconographic, technical, material, structural... a body of work of different methods to get results
