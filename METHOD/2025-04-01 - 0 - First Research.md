## Coins et Recoins: new method of field observation

It pertains to researching aspects related to my thesis by concentrating my observation on "forgotten" spaces (physically or digitally.)

Wendy Chun talks about the visible invisible, and the invisible visible. This research looks into a more literal interpretation of what she talked about in her book [Insert Titlte of Book].


> Exercice #7: Coins et Recoins 

> In a more or less defined territory (an urban neighborhood, the area around a train station or transportation hub, a forest), observe the less accessible corners at first glance: the hidden pathways (to be identified beforehand on a map), the nooks of a room or a large building if you're in an indoor space, the spaces between two buildings, two trees, or two objects, the various crevices (a hole in a façade, a pothole, a cavity in a rocky surface). Take photos, draw, or write down everything and every being you encounter there.

> Then, create an abecedarium (A–Z list) composed of a list and a short text for each entry, organized in alphabetical order. 

This was an exercise assigned by Joël Vacheron, yesterday. I applied this research on my thesis research, in two parts. First, a physical observation where I explore the world's hidden corners, especially in Geneva. Then, a digital obsveration, where I look into the web's most distanced parts.
