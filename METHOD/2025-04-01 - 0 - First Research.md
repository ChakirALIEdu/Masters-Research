## Coins et Recoins: new method of field observation

It pertains to researching aspects related to my thesis by concentrating my observation on "forgotten" spaces (physically or digitally.)

Wendy Chun talks about the visible invisible, and the invisible visible. This research looks into a more literal interpretation of what she talked about in her book *"Programmed Visions: Software and Memory".*


> Exercice #7: Coins et Recoins 

> In a more or less defined territory (an urban neighborhood, the area around a train station or transportation hub, a forest), observe the less accessible corners at first glance: the hidden pathways (to be identified beforehand on a map), the nooks of a room or a large building if you're in an indoor space, the spaces between two buildings, two trees, or two objects, the various crevices (a hole in a façade, a pothole, a cavity in a rocky surface). Take photos, draw, or write down everything and every being you encounter there.

> Then, create an abecedarium (A–Z list) composed of a list and a short text for each entry, organized in alphabetical order. 

This was an exercise assigned by Joël Vacheron, yesterday. I applied this research on my thesis research, in two parts. First, a physical observation where I explore the world's hidden corners, especially in Geneva. Then, a digital obsveration, where I look into the web's most distanced parts.



## TL;DR, for those that don't want to read my research of the day:

The key insights are that there is an inverse relationship between comfort and privacy/control:


> High comfort → Lower privacy needs (Anière's open community)

>High control → Lower comfort but more authentic expression (Neocities sites)

> Corporate comfort → Loss of control (Social media platforms)

 The more comfortable and convenient a space becomes (physical or digital), the more it tends to erode privacy and individual control.
