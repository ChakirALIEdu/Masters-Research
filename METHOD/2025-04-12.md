# Thoughts (2025-04-12)



My mom told me about payments that annoyed her. 

She mentionned how she had monthly payments that wouldn't stop bothering her (why?).

She went to Visilab to finish the payments and they said "We can't do anything because the system already sent the payment and it can't change."

Something about this ticked me.

Why was it designed to... inconvenience this time? Hmm... Some method payment that seemed like a convenience turned out to be a direct inconvenience?

It didn't annoy her actually, but she didn't receive payments by email.
So the email didn't work, and she immediately received a late payment fee.

They never sent her emails. She controlled her email data with them.
Then she asked them to send payments vis post, but it cost 3 more swiss francs per payments.

So it seemed to be designed to make people pay more, to make more profits.


I'll find a way to link this back to my thesis.
