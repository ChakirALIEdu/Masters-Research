    ε=ε=ε=ε=ε=ε=┌(;￣◇￣)┘

I wanna try a secret plan, in which I employ two methods:

> Method 1) 
> Ask people to give their full information after completing a survey. My hypothesis is that, since giving out identifiable info isn't a prerequisite to completing the test, people would refrain from doing so, or be hesitant. (Though, perhaps a survey isn't necessarily the only thing I can get them to do)

> Method 2) 
> Offer a service for free, but block its access until people give their data. What I also would wanna see is how much information I can get away with "stealing" just for their convenience.

But that's probably for another time. I'll have to bring it up to Joël Vacheron.

Also, I need to correct mistakes in my documents. Typoes and all.


I also would really like to do a retrospective on last week's insights.
I haven't really slept well at all last night so I'm scared I won't be able to do it correctly.
Perhaps I don't notice it yet, but maybe I've already written 50 typoes here and 5 intelligible sentences. I'll hold back for now.
