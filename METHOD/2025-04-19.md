My actual goal would be to prove an alternative can work. 
I want to write about an alternative in which softwares can gain success by allowing more control to users, or at the very least stepping back from this control (which also inadvertently creates computer illiteracy...)

I want to prove that NOT using design to coerce users is better, if possible. I think that's the goal of my master's thesis. Prove that an alternative is so good, so truthful, so inevitable, that the method we're using now is obsolete and outrageous in comparison. 


"FRICTIONLESS DESIGN IS COERCION AND CONTROL. FRICTION IS THE ALTERNATIVE, AND THE SOLUTION."
